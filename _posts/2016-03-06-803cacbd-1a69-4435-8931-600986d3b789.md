The Sound Off releases our top 5 rising rappers to look for 2016\. The following made some big steps in 2015 on the road to stardom. Keep you ears to the ground for these 5 rappers coming to a speaker near you this year.

[Deezy Freeman][0]

- When interviewed in October, Deezy said he had "40 songs ready". This was prior to his US tour and soon to be released music video featuring Rayven Justice 'Oh Yeah'. His debut track 'PussyJuice' made the top 10 on the German Rap Charts. The SGM Records product is focused and ready to kill the charts in 2016\.

[Royzy Rothschild][1]

- The Liverpool UK rapper never seems to sleep. The former video store owner now turned rapper is dropping video after video. Royzy has owned two record labels and two publishing companies. Can someone say workaholic? We can expect him not to slow down in 2016\. Check out his cartoon animated music video for his track 'Duck Out Of Water'.

[Dream Jefferson][2]

- Electro-hip-hop group Dream Jefferson dropped '32X' in 2015 and handful of music videos to go along with it including 'The Filth' and 'Light Therapy'. The Toronto rap duo is constantly gigging and it seems they drop a new album every year. Excited to see what they drop in 2016\.

[Bäsh][3]

- The Newark rapper arrived on the scene a couple of months ago with his first record, a the slow tempo track called "All The Time". A few more interesting releases later, Bäsh decides to drop his very first visual for his buzzing record. With more great music in the works, 2016 is looking bright for the 18 year old Newark, New Jersey rapper.

[Dondatta Hoffa][4]

- The NJ rapper is no stranger to Jamsterdam Radio, his track 'Enlightened' topped the daily Top 10 upon release and it seems he is releasing a new track every week. The Don does not seem to be slowing down after being featured in multiple industry magazines and toted by some as the next up and comer.
