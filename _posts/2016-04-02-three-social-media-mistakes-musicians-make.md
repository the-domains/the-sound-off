# Social Media Mistakes Musicians Make

Social media is a crucial tool all artists and bands need to take advantage of. It is very simple to post about a recent single or new video release time and time again. There are some important facts you must consider to avoid wasting your time and start getting the most out of your social media platforms.

For starters, what is it you are trying to accomplish? Records sales? A loyal fan base? Gig promotion? All of the above? Well, there are quite a few mistakes artists make when using social media. Here are the top 3:

# \#1: Lack of Presence

There are tons of talented artists creating amazing music whose friends are all curious as to why they have not been signed to a label or why they are still working dead end jobs to pay for their next studio album. 

Creating the music is only half the battle to making your musical endeavors a success. Musicians need to be active on their social media channels. Daily posting is important but don't repeatedly pollute your follower news feeds with your recent album release. Social Media is a great way to gain free advertising but add value to your followers as well.

The worst possible social media experience for a potential fan is they hear about your awesome band and then go check out your Facebook page only to see your last post was a month ago. Makes me question whether the band is still together. Keep your social media feeds fresh with content.

# \#2 Too much Self Promotion

Majority of artists are way too busy promoting themselves that they forget about adding value to their followers. With the amount of self promoting going on out in the world of social media it all becomes white noise. The key to differentiating yourself amongst your competition is to think about the value you are providing for your followers.

Try the 4-1-1 rule; for your next 6 posts, ensure 4 posts add value to your followers. You could add value through a viral video, community news or a music festival, something not related to your band. One post should direct followers to your web site and one post you can promote an album release or song. This remedy has worked best with the team over at [FreshCrowd.rocks][0].

They have plenty of interesting content that they curate with a healthy mix of your pictures, lyrics, tracks and upcoming events which are displayed on your social media feeds daily.

# \#3 Forget About an E-mail List

Many artists neglect the golden opportunity of an e-mail list. E-mails can easily be collected through your web site, Facebook, or at a live event and its a mystery why so many artists are not utilizing this very effective marketing strategy tool.

E-mail marketing creates a direct connection to your fans and is the best way to market a live event or album release. I would suggest getting an e-mail at the very least before giving away your music for free.
