# Three Social Media Mistakes Musicians Make

Social media is a crucial tool all artists and bands need to take advantage of. It is very simple to post about an upcoming release or new video time and time again. There are some important facts you must consider to avoid wasting your time and start getting the most out of your social media platforms.

For starters, what is it you are trying to accomplish? Records sales? A loyal fan base? Gig promotion? All of the above? Well, there are quite a few mistakes artists make when using social media. Here are the top 3:

# \#1: Lack of Presence

There are tons of talented artists creating amazing music whose friends are all curious as to why and how they have not been signed to a label or why they are still working at dead end jobs to pay for their next studio album. 

Creating the music is only half of the battle to making your musical endeavors a success. Musicians need to be active on their social media channels. Daily posting is important but be sure to not just be polluting your followers news feeds with your recent album release. Social Media is a great way to gain free advertising but be sure to add value to your followers as well.

The worst possible social media experience for a potential follower is they hear about you band and then go to check you our on Facebook only to see your last post was a month ago. Makes them question whether the band is still together. Keep you social media feeds fresh with content.

# \#2 Too much Self Promotion

Majority of artists are way too busy promoting themselves that they forget about adding value to their follower. With the amount of self promoting going on out in the world of social media it all becomes white noise. The key to differentiating yourself amungst your competition is to think about the value you are providing to your followers.

Try the 4-1-1 rule; for your next 6 posts, ensure 4 posts add value to your followers. You could add value through a viral video, community news or a music festival, something not related to your band. One post should direct followers to your web site and one post you can promote an album release or song. This remedy has worked best with the team over at [FreshCrowd.rocks][0]

# \#3 Forget About an E-mail List

Many artists neglect the golden opportunity of an e-mail list. E-mails can easily be collected through your web site, Facebook, or at a live event and its a mystery why so many artists are not utilizing this very effective marketing strategy tool.

E-mail marketing creates a direct connection to your fans and is the best way to market a live event or album release. I would suggest getting an e-mail at the very least before giving away your music for free.
